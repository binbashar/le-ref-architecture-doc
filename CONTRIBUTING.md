### Collaborate on fixes for security vulnerabilities in private forks

Working in the open means that it is impossible to hide things. And yet, sometimes you will want
to work on some changes in the code in private, for example when fixing a security vulnerability.

Working on a fix in the open might allow attackers to reverse engineer the bug and attack our users.
Since GitHub provides a mechanism to easily create a private fork of our repo, please use this
private forks to collaborate on a security fix.

### Publish maintainer advisories for security fixes

Fixing a security vulnerability is no small feat and we should tell our users about it.
We will do it in a way that will make it easy for you to learn about it and patch

Since GitHub provides an easy way to publish a security advisory, this will
be incorporated and you could add it into your security scanning tools, the ones you
depend on to keep your applications secure.
