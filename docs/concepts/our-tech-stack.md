# Our Tech Stack
Leverage was built around the [AWS Well Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) and it uses a stack that includes [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and other tools.

We are also adopters and supporters of Kubernetes and the Cloud Native movement, which should become self-evident as you keep exploring our technology stack.

## Why did we choose our tech stack?

??? info "Why Infra as Code (IaC) & Terraform❓"

    - [x] **Confidence:** A change breaks the env? Just roll it back. Still not working?
    Build a whole new env with a few keystrokes. IaC enables this.

    - [x] **Repeatability:** Allows your infra to be automatically instantiated, making it
    easy to build multiple identical envs.

    - [x] **Troubleshooting:** Check source control and see exactly what changed in the env. 
    As long as you are diligent and don’t make manual envs changes, then IaC can be a game
    changer.

    - [x] **DR:** Require the ability to set up an alternate env in a different DC or Region.
    IaC makes this a much more manageable prospect.

    - [x] **Auditability:**
    You will need to be able to audit both changes and access to an env, IaC gives you this
    right out of the box.

    - [x] **Visibility:** As an env expands over time, is challenging to tell what has been
    provisioned. In the #cloud this can be a huge #cost issue. IaC allows tracking your
    resources.

    - [x] **Portability:** Some IaC techs are #multicloud. Also, translating #Terraform from
    one cloud provider to another is considerably more simple than recreating your entire
    envs in a cloud-specific tool.

    - [x] **Security:** See history of changes to your SG rules along with commit messages can
    do wonders for being confident about the security configs of your envs.

    **Terraform** allows to codify your application infrastructure, reduce human error and 
    increase automation by provisioning infrastructure as code.
    With TF we can manage infrastructure across clouds and provision infrastructure 
    across 300+ public clouds and services using a single workflow.
    Moreover it helps to create reproducible infrastructure and provision consistent testing,
    staging, and production environments with the same configuration.

    **Terraform** has everything we expect from a IaC framework: open source, cloud-agnostic
    provisioning tool that supported immutable infrastructure, a declarative language, and
    a client-only architecture.

??? info "Why Organizations❓"
    AWS Organizations helps you centrally manage and govern your environment as you grow
    and scale your AWS resources. Using AWS Organizations, you can programmatically create
    new AWS accounts and allocate resources, group accounts to organize your workflows,
    apply policies to accounts or groups for governance, and simplify billing by using a 
    single payment method for all of your accounts.
