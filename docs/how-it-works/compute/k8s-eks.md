# Kubernetes AWS EKS

[**Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Services** (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) is a managed service that makes it easy for you 
to run **Kubernetes** on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane or worker nodes. 

!!! check "Core Features"
    - [x] Highly Secure: EKS automatically applies the latest security patches to your cluster control plane. 
    - [x] Multiple Availability Zones: EKS auto-detects and replaces unhealthy control plane nodes and provides on-demand,
     zero downtime upgrades and patching.
    - [x] Serverless Compute: EKS supports AWS Fargate to remove the need to provision and manage servers, improving
     security through application isolation by design. 
    - [x] Built with the Community: AWS actively works with the Kubernetes community, including making contributions to the
     Kubernetes code base helping you take advantage of AWS services.

## Version support convention
At Leverage we support the last 3 latest stable 
[Kubernetes version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/kubernetes-versions.html) releases (at best effort)
within our
[Reference Architecture EKS layer](https://github.com/binbashar/le-tf-infra-aws/tree/master/apps-devstg/k8s-eks) 
and [IaC Library EKS module](https://github.com/binbashar/terraform-aws-eks)

We think this is a good balance between management overhead and an acceptable level of 
supported versions (at best effort). If your project have and older legacy version we could work along
your CloudOps team to safely migrate it to a Leverage supported EKS version.
