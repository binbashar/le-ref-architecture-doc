     - [x] **Route53** private hosted zone will have associations with VPCs on different AWS organization accounts
     - [x] **Route53** should ideally be hosted in the Shared account, although sometimes Route53 is already deployed in a Legacy
        account where it can be imported and fully supported as code.
     - [x] **Route53** [zero downtime migration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-migrating.html) 
        (active-active hosted zones) is completely possible and achievable with Leverage terraform code
