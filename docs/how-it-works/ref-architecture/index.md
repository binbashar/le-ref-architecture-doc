# How it works
The objective of this document is to explain how the **binbash Leverage Reference Architecture for AWS**
works, in particular how the Reference Architecture model is built and why we need it.

## Overview
This documentation contains all the guidelines to create binbash 
Leverage Reference Architecture for AWS that will be implemented on the 
Projectsâ€™ AWS infrastructure.

We're assuming you've already have in place your AWS Landing Zone based on the
[First Steps](/try-leverage/index.md) guide. 

!!! check "Our Purpose"
    * [x] **Democratize advanced technologies:** As complex as it may sound, the basic idea behind this design principle is 
    simple. It is not always possible for a business to maintain a capable in-house IT department while staying up to
    date. It is entirely feasible to set up your own cloud computing ecosystem from scratch without experience, but that
    would take a considerable amount of resources; it is definitely not the most efficient way to go. 
    * [x] **An efficient business-minded** way to go is to employ AWS as a service allows organizations to benefit from
    the advanced technologies integrated into AWS without learning, researching, or creating teams specifically for
    those technologies.

!!! info
    This documentation will provide a detailed reference of the tools and techs used, 
    the needs they address and how they fit with the multiple practices we will be implementing.
