# AWS Security & Compliance Services

!!! danger "Security Directives"
    There will not be any instance port or service port open to general access, unless justified by business reasons, 
    and weâ€™ll take alternative means of security to mitigate any possible risk.
    
    Every account will have a set of active services that will allow for administrative users (SecOps) to audit all 
    actions and track potentially dangerous behavior. All services will be enabled via IaC (Terraform or SDK and tracked
    in the proper git repo).
