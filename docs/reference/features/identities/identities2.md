# Identity and Access Management (IAM) Layer

## Summary
Having this [official AWS resource](https://d0.awsstatic.com/aws-answers/AWS_Multi_Account_Security_Strategy.pdf) 
as reference  we've define a security account structure for managing multiple accounts.

!!! tip "User Management Definitions ![aws-service](../../../assets/images/icons/aws-emojipack/General_AWScloud.png){: style="width:30px"} ![aws-service](../../../assets/images/icons/aws-emojipack/SecurityIdentityCompliance_IAM.png){: style="width:15px"}" 
    *   [x] IAM users will strictly be created and centralized in the Security account (member accounts IAM Users could be exceptionally created for very specific tools that still donâ€™t support IAM roles for cross-account auth). 
    *   [x] All access to resources within the Client organization will be assigned via policy documents attached to IAM roles or groups.
    *   [x] All IAM roles and groups will have the least privileges required to properly work.
    *   [x] IAM AWS and Customer managed policies will be defined, inline policies will be avoided whenever possible.
    *   [x] All user management will be maintained as code and will reside in the DevOps repository.
    *   [x] All users will have MFA enabled whenever possible (VPN and AWS Web Console).
    *   [x] Root user credentials will be rotated and secured. MFA for root will be enabled. 
    *   [x] IAM Access Keys for root will be disabled.
    *   [x] IAM root access will be monitored via CloudWatch Alerts.

!!! info "Why multi account IAM strategy?"
    Creating a security relationship between accounts makes it even easier for companies to assess the security 
    of AWS-based deployments, centralize security monitoring and management, manage identity and access, and provide 
    audit and compliance monitoring services
