    * Sites or APIs are down

!!! danger "**Prometheus Alert Manager (black box, metrics-based)**"
    * [http://prometheus.aws.domain.com/](http://prometheus.aws.domain.com/)
    * Clusters issues (masters/nodes high resources usage)
    * Instance issues (Pritunl VPN, Jenkins, Spinnaker, Grafana, Kibana, etc)
    * Alerts from Prometheus Blackbox Exporter

!!! danger "**Kibana ElastAlert (black box, logs-based)**"
    *   Intended for applications/services logs

# Implementation Reference Example

!!! tip "**Slack**"
    All alerts are sent to #engineering-urgent-alerts channel. Members that are online can have visibility from there.
    AlertManager takes care of sending such alerts according to the rules defined here: **TODO**
    
    **Note:** there is a channel named `engineering-alerts` but is used for Github notifications. It didn’t make sense to
    mix real alerts with that, that is why a new `engineering-urgent-alerts` channel was created. As a recommendation,
    Github notifications should be sent to a channel named like #engineering-notifications and leave
    `engineering-alerts` for real alerts.

!!! tip "**PagerDuty**"
    AlertManager only sends to PagerDuty alerts that are labeled as **severity: critical**. PagerDuty is configured to 
    turn these into [incidents](https://domain.pagerduty.com/incidents) according to the settings
    defined [here](https://domain.pagerduty.com/service-directory) for the
    [Prometheus Critical Alerts service](https://domain.pagerduty.com/service-directory). The aforementioned
    service uses [HiPriorityAllYearRound escalation policy](https://domain.pagerduty.com/escalation_policies)
    to define who gets notified and how.
    
    **Note:** currently only the TechOwnership role gets notified as we don’t have agreements or rules about on-call 
    support but this can be easily changed in the future to accommodate business decisions.

!!! tip "**UpTimeRobot**"
    We are doing basic http monitoring on the following sites:
    *   www.domain_1.com
    *   www.domain_2.com
    *   www.domain_3.com

    **Note:** a personal account has been set up for this. As a recommendation, an new account should be created using
     an email account that belongs to your project.
