# Try Leverage

## Before you begin

The objective of this guide is to introduce you to our
[**binbash Leverage Reference Architecture for AWS**](/user-guide/ref-architecture-aws/overview/) workflow 
through the complete deployment of a basic landing zone configuration.

The Leverage Landing Zone is the smallest possible fully functional configuration. 
It lays out the base infrastructure required to manage the environment: billing and
financial management, user management, security enforcement, and shared services and
resources. Always following the best practices layed out by the
[AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html) 
to ensure quality and to provide a solid base to build upon. This is the starting point from which
any Leverage user can and will develop all the features and capabilities they may require to satisfy
their specific needs.
