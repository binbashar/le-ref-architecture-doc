# Post-deployment steps
At this point the landing zone should be ready.

The bootstrap user can now be deleted.

## Delete the bootstrap user

- Log into your `sso_start_url` address with your SSO user
- Select the `management` account and log into the `Management console`
- Go to IAM
- Delete the user `mgmt-org-admin`

## Adding SSO users and groups

To add users or groups, please see [SSO Managing Users document](/user-guide/ref-architecture-aws/features/sso/managing-users).

## Next steps
Now you not only have a fully functional landing zone configuration deployed, but also are able to interact with it using your own AWS SSO credentials.
