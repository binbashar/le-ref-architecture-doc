# Command: `terraform` | `tf`

The `terraform` command is a wrapper for a containerized installation of Terraform. It provides the Terraform executable with specific configuration values required by Leverage.

It transparently handles MFA on behalf of the user in the commands that require it. Some commands can only be run at **layer** level and will not run anywhere else in the project.

The command can also be invoked via its shortened version `tf`.
