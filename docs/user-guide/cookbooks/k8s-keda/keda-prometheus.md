# K8s pod autoscaling with KEDA based on Promehteus metrics

Scale applications based on Prometheus. 

## Goal

To configure a KEDA Autoscaler based on Prometheus metrics to a K8s service.

### Assumptions

We are assuming the [**binbash Leverage**](https://leverage.binbash.co/) [Landing Zone](https://leverage.binbash.co/try-leverage/) is deployed, an account called `apps-devstg` was created and region `us-east-1` is being used. In any case you can adapt these examples to other scenarios.
