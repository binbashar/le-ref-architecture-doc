  -v, --verbose        Increase output verbosity.

  --help               Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  aws          Run AWS CLI commands in a custom containerized environment.
  credentials  Manage AWS cli credentials.

  tfautomv     Run TFAutomv commands in a custom containerized...
```

Similarly, subcommands provide further information by means of the `--help` flag. For example `leverage tf --help`.

## Global options
* `-f` | `--filename`:  Name of the file containing the tasks' definition. Defaults to `build.py`
* `-l` | `--list-tasks`: List all the tasks defined for the project along a description of their purpose (when available).  
  ```
  Tasks in build file `build.py`:

    clean                  	Clean build directory.
    copy_file              	
    echo

  ```
* `-v` | `--verbose`: Increases output verbosity.  
  When running a command in a container, the tool provides a description of the container's configuration before the execution.  
  This is specially useful if the user were to to have the need of recreating Leverage's behavior by themselves.

    2. Environment variables available in the container
    3. Mapping of the host (`Source`) directories and files into the container (`Target`)
    4. Command being executed (useful when trying to replicate Leverage's behavior by yourself)
