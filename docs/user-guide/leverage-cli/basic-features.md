# Basic CLI features

To view a list of all the available commands and options in your current Leverage version simply run `leverage` or `leverage --help`. You should get an output similar to this:
``` bash
$ leverage
Usage: leverage [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Leverage Reference Architecture projects command-line tool.

Options:
  -v, --verbose  Increase output verbosity.
  --version      Show the version and exit.
  --help         Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  aws          Run AWS CLI commands in a custom containerized environment.
  credentials  Manage AWS cli credentials.
  kc           Run Kubectl commands in a custom containerized environment.
  kubectl      Run Kubectl commands in a custom containerized environment.
  project      Manage a Leverage project.
  run          Perform specified task(s) and all of its dependencies.
  shell        Run a shell in a generic container.
  terraform    Run Terraform commands in a custom containerized...
  tf           Run Terraform commands in a custom containerized...
  tfautomv     Run TFAutomv commands in a custom containerized...
```

Similarly, subcommands provide further information by means of the `--help` flag. For example `leverage tf --help`.

## Global options
* `-v` | `--verbose`: Increases output verbosity.  
  When running a command in a container, the tool provides a description of the container's configuration before the execution.  
  This is specially useful if the user were to to have the need of recreating Leverage's behavior by themselves.  
  ``` bash
  $ leverage -v tf plan

    1. :simple-docker: Docker image being used
    2. Environment variables available in the container
    3. Mapping of the host (`Source`) directories and files into the container (`Target`)
    4. Command being executed (useful when trying to replicate Leverage's behavior by yourself)
