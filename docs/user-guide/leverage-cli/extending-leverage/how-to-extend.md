# Extending & Configuring leverage CLI

## Override defaults via `build.env` file
By utilizing the [`build.env` capability](https://github.com/binbashar/leverage/blob/master/leverage/conf.py), you can
easily change some default behaviors of the CLI. This allows you to specify several configurations for the CLI, 
such as the
[Leverage-Toolbox-Image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/binbash/leverage-toolbox/general) that you want to
use, ensuring that you are using the latest version or a specific version that you prefer based on your [compatibility
requirements](https://leverage.binbash.com.ar/work-with-us/releases/versions-compatibility-matrix/#compatibility-matrix). 
This helps you avoid compatibility issues and ensures that your infrastructure deployments go smoothly.

    [build.env](./build.env.md) entry.

## `.tfvars` config files
Using additional `.tfvars` configuration files at the account level or at the global level will allow you to extend your
terraform configuration entries. Consider that using multiple `.tfvars` configuration files allows you to keep your 
configuration entries well-organized. You can have separate files for different accounts or environments, making it easy
to manage and maintain your infrastructure. This also makes it easier for other team members to understand and work with
your configuration, reducing the risk of misconfigurations or errors.

## Custom tasks with build.py 
Leverage CLI has a native mechanism to allow customizing your workflow. With the custom tasks feature using `build.py`,
you can write your own tasks using Python, tailoring the CLI to fit your specific workflow. This allows you to automate
and streamline your infrastructure deployments, reducing the time and effort required to manage your infrastructure. 
You can also easily integrate other tools and services into your workflow to further improve your productivity.
