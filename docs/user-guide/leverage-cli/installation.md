# Installation

To use Leverage CLI you need to install it from the Python Package Index (Pypi). Currently, only Linux and Mac OS are supported operative systems.

!!! done "Requirements"
    * [x] **Python** `>= 3.8`
    * [x] **Git** `>= 2.25`
    * [x] **Docker engine** `>= 20.x.y`

    Check out [the troubleshooting section](/user-guide/troubleshooting/general) to find more help.

###Install Pip

=== "Ubuntu/Debian"

    ``` bash
    $ sudo apt install python3-pip
    ```

=== "CentOS/RHEL"

    ``` bash
    $ sudo yum install python3-pip
    ```

=== "Fedora"

    ``` bash
    $ sudo dnf install python3-pip
    ```

=== "MacOS"

    Pip should already be installed alongside your Python 3 installation. If for whatever reason this is not the case:
    ``` bash
    $ brew install python3
    ```

###Install Leverage CLI

$ pip3 install leverage

```

Upgrade to the latest stable version

$ pip3 install --upgrade leverage
```

##Installation in an isolated environment

If you prefer not to install the Leverage package globally and would like to limit its influence to only the directory of your project, we recommend using tools like [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). These tools are commonly used when working with python applications and help manage common issues that may result from installing and using such applications globally.

##Shell completion

To enable autocompletion for Leverage in your shell, do the following:

=== "Bash"

    Add to `~/.bashrc`:
    ``` bash
    eval "$(_LEVERAGE_COMPLETE=bash_source leverage)"
    ```

=== "Zsh"

    Add to `~/.zshrc`:
    ``` bash
    eval "$(_LEVERAGE_COMPLETE=zsh_source leverage)"
    ```

=== "Fish"

    Add to `~/.config/fish/completions/leverage.fish`:
    ``` bash
    eval (env _LEVERAGE_COMPLETE=fish_source leverage)
    ```

Or to avoid invoking `eval` every time a shell starts:

=== "Bash"

    Save the script:
    ``` bash
    _LEVERAGE_COMPLETE=bash_source leverage > ~/.leverage-complete.bash
    ```
    Source the script in `~/.bashrc`:
    ``` bash
    . ~/.leverage-complete.bash
    ```

=== "Zsh"

    Save the script:
    ``` bash
    _LEVERAGE_COMPLETE=zsh_source leverage > ~/.leverage-complete.zsh
    ```
    Source the script in `~/.zshrc`:
    ``` bash
    . ~/.leverage-complete.zsh
    ```

=== "Fish"

    Save the script to `~/.config/fish/completions/leverage.fish`:
    ``` bash
    _LEVERAGE_COMPLETE=fish_source leverage > ~/.config/fish/completions/leverage.fish
    ```

Start a new shell in order to load any changes made to the shell config.
