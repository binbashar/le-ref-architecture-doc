# Leverage CLI

## Overview
Leverage CLI is the tool used to manage and interact with any Leverage project.

It transparently handles the most complex and error prone tasks that arise from working with a state-of-the-art infrastructure definition like our Leverage Reference Architecture. Leverage CLI uses a dockerized approach to encapsulate the tools needed to perform such tasks and to free the user from having to deal with the configuration and management of said tools.
