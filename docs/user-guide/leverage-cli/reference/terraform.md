# Command: `terraform` | `tf`

The `terraform` command is a wrapper for a containerized installation of Terraform. It provides the Terraform executable with specific configuration values required by Leverage.

It transparently handles authentication, whether it is Multi-Factor or via Single Sign-On, on behalf of the user in the commands that require it. SSO Authentication takes precedence over MFA when both are active. 

Some commands can only be run at **layer** level and will not run anywhere else in the project.

The command can also be invoked via its shortened version `tf`.

### Options
* `--mfa`: Authenticate via MFA upon launching shell.
* `--sso`: Authenticate via SSO upon launching shell.

_Note:_ When `--sso` flag is used, the `--mfa` flag status is ignored.

!!! example "What if I want to run a Terraform command that is not supported by the CLI?"
    One common error you could encounter is `"Error acquiring the state lock"`, where you might need to use `force-unlock`. You can do the following:

    1. `leverage terraform shell --sso`.
