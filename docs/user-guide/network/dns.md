    * :gear: Review & understand the [**workflow**](../base-workflow/repo-le-tf-infra.md) 


!!! example "Steps"
    1. **DNS** service has to be orchestrated from 
    [`/shared/base-dns`](https://github.com/binbashar/le-tf-infra-aws/tree/master/shared/base-dns) layer 
    following the standard [workflow](../base-workflow/repo-le-tf-infra.md)
    2. To associate AWS Org Member accounts to your DNS Private Hosted Zones eg: `*.aws.domain.com` 
    (previously deployed) proceed applying the corresponding layers
        1. [apps-devstg/base-dns](https://github.com/binbashar/le-tf-infra-aws/tree/master/apps-devstg/base-dns)
        2. [apps-prd/base-dns](https://github.com/binbashar/le-tf-infra-aws/tree/master/apps-prd/base-dns)
        3. repeat for every other necessary AWS Organizations Member account.
        
### Migrated AWS Route53 Hosted Zones between AWS Accounts 

We'll need to setup the Route53 DNS service with an active-active config to avoid any type of service disruption and 
downtime. This would then allow the Name Servers of both AWS Accounts to be added to your domain provider
(eg: [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/)) and have for example: 

* 4 x ns (`project-legacy` Route53 Account) 
* 4 x ns (`project-shared` Route53 Account) 

After the records have propagated and everything looks OK we could remove the `project-legacy` Route53 ns from your
domain provider (eg: [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/)) and leave only the of `project-shared` ones.

This [official Migrating a hosted zone to a different AWS account - Amazon Route 53 article](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-migrating.html) 
explains this procedure step by step:

!!! example "AWS Route53 hosted zone migration steps" 
    1. Create records in the new hosted zone (bb-shared)
    2. Compare records in the old and new hosted zones (bb-legacy)
    3. Update the domain registration to use name servers for the new hosted zone (NIC updated to use both 
    bb-legacy + bb-shared)
    4. Wait for DNS resolvers to start using the new hosted zone
    5. (Optional) delete the old hosted zone (bb-legacy), remember you'll need to delete the ns delegation 
    records from your domain registration (NIC) too.
