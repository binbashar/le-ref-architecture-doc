# Service Mesh

## Overview
Ultra light, ultra simple, ultra powerful. Linkerd adds security, observability, and 
reliability to Kubernetes, without the complexity. CNCF-hosted and 100% open source.

## How it works

!!! summary "How Linkerd works"
    Linkerd works by installing a set of ultralight, transparent proxies next to each
    service instance. These proxies automatically handle all traffic to and from the service.
    Because theyâ€™re transparent, these proxies act as highly instrumented out-of-process
    network stacks, sending telemetry to, and receiving control signals from, the control plane.
    This design allows Linkerd to measure and manipulate traffic to and from your service
    without introducing excessive latency.
