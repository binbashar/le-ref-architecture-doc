# Metrics
There are [**metrics**](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-metrics-monitoring-and-alerting) 
that are going to be of interest both in the infrastructure itself (CPU, Memory, disk) and also on 
application level (amount of non 200 responses, latency, % of errors) and we will have two key sources for this: 
Prometheus and [AWS CloudWatch metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html).

!!! check "Metric collectors"
    * :bar_chart: **CloudWatch metrics:** Is where amazon stores a great number of default metrics for each of its services. Useful
    data here can be interpreted and alerts can be generated with Cloudwatch alerts and can also be used as a source for
    Grafana. Although this is a very good offering, we have found it to be incomplete and highly bound to AWS services but
    not integrated enough with the rest of the ecosystem.
    * :bar_chart: **Prometheus:** This is an open source tool (by Soundcloud) that is essentially a time-series database. It stores
    metrics, and it has the advantage of being highly integrated with all Kubernetes things. In fact, Kubernetes is already
    publishing various metrics in Prometheus format “out of the box”. It’s alerting capabilities are also remarkable, and it
    can all be kept as code in a repository.  It has a big community behind it, and it’s not far fetched at this point to
    include a library in your own application that provides you with the ability to create an endpoint that publishes
    certain metrics about your own application, that we can graph or alert based on them.

!!! check "Graphing metrics" 
    Grafana is the standard open source visualization tool which can be used on top of a variety of different data
    stores. It can use prometheus as a source, and there are many open source dashboards and plugins available that
    provide great visualization of how things are running, and we can also build our own if necessary. If something is
    left out of prometheus and already available in Cloudwatch metrics we can easily integrate it as a source for
    Grafana as well, and build dashboards that integrate these metrics and even do some intelligence on them coming
    from multiple origins.

!!! attention "Alerting based on metrics" 
    Although Grafana already has alerting capabilities built in, we rather (most of the times) have Prometheus alerting
    engine configured, because we can have really customize and specify alerts. We can have them as code in their
    extremely readable syntax. Example:
