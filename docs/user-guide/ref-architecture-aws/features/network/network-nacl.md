# AWS Network Access Control List (NACLs)
AWS Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) sevice it's crucial to implement robust security measures within your AWS environment.

## How it works
Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) act as a virtual firewall for your AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. They operate on a rule-based system, allowing or denying traffic based on defined rules.


## Default vs Custom NACLs

##### Default NACLs:
  - This NACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic by default. It serves as a basic level of security, ensuring that your resources can communicate within the VPC and to the internet.

##### Dedicated NACLs:
  - Dedicated NACLs are manually created and associated with a specific subnet within your VPC. They offer a higher level of customization and control over the traffic flow. This means you can tailor the rules to meet your specific security requirements for your workload and applications

## Pros and Cons:
#### Default NACL
##### **Pros:**

1. *Convenience:* They are automatically created with each new VPC, saving time during the initial setup.
1. *Basic Protection:* Provides a baseline level of security for your VPC resources.

##### **Cons:**

1. *Limited Customization:* Offers less flexibility in terms of rule configuration.
1. *Less Granular Control:* May not meet specific security requirements for complex environments.


#### Custom Dedicated NACLs

##### Pros:
1. *Granular Control:* Allows for fine-tuning of inbound and outbound traffic rules.
1. *Enhanced Security:* Provides the ability to create custom rules for specific resources and subnets.
1. *Isolation:* Allows you to isolate specific subnets for added security.

##### Cons:
1. *Manual Configuration:* Requires manual creation and association with subnets, which can be time-consuming.
1. *Potential Complexity:* If not properly configured, it may lead to unintended connectivity issues.


## Best practices and recomendations
  - [x] Given the recurrent challenges and complications associated with NACLs, especially during real-time troubleshooting, a safer default approach is to have them disabled by defualt. This ensures a smoother experience for most users while still providing the flexibility to enable NACLs when necessary.
  - [x] Periodically assess and update your NACL rules to ensure they align with your evolving security requirements.
  - [x] Users or tech leads wishing to enable custom dedicated NACLs must undergo an explicit approval process.
  - [x] Feedback mechanisms should be in place to inform users of the status of NACLs and any associated permissions.
  - [x] Comprehensive testing should be conducted to ensure that the default disabling of NACLs does not introduce new issues.
  - [x] Enable logging for your NACLs to gain visibility into traffic patterns and potential security incidents.


## Conclusion
AWS Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) are a fundamental aspect of securing your VPC. While default NACLs provide a basic level of security, dedicated NACLs offer greater customization and control. By combining these measures and following best practices, you can establish a robust security framework within your AWS environment
