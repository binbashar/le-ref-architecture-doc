# Audit | CloudTrail

## Overview
AWS CloudTrail monitors and records account activity across your AWS infrastructure, 
giving you control over storage, analysis, and remediation actions.

!!! info "AWS CloudTrail overview"
    This service will be configured to enable auditing of all AWS services in all accounts.
    Once enabled, as shown in the below presented figure, CloudTrail will deliver all events 
    from all accounts to the Security account in order to have a centralized way to audit 
    operations on AWS resources.
    Audit events will be available from CloudTrail for 90 days but a longer retention 
    time will be available through a centralized S3 bucket.
