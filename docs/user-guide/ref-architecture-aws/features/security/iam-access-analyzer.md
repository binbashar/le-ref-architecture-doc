## AWS Organizations
!!! important "CONSIDERATION: AWS Organization integration"
    In order to enable ***AccessAnalyzer*** with the Organization at the zone of
    of trust in the **Security** account, this account needs to be set as a *delegated
    administrator*. 

    Such step cannot be performed by Terraform yet so it was set
    up manually as described below:
    [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-settings.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-settings.html)
    
    If you're configuring AWS IAM Access Analyzer in your AWS Organizations management account, 
    you can add a member account in the organization as the delegated administrator to manage 
    Access Analyzer for your organization. The delegated administrator has permissions to create 
    and manage analyzers with the organization as the zone of trust. Only the management account 
    can add a delegated administrator.
