# Storage


## Overview
We will review all S3 buckets in the existing account to determine if itâ€™s necessary to copy over to the new account, 
evaluate existing bucket policy and tightening permissions to be absolutely minimum required for users and applications.
As for EBS volumes, our recommendation is to create all encrypted by default. Overhead created by this process is negligible.
