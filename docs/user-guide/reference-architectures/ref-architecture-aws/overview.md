# AWS Reference Architecture

## Overview
Our AWS Reference Architecture was created on a set of opinionated definitions and conventions on:

* [how to organize files/folders](dir-structure.md),
* where to store [configuration files](configs.md),
* how to handle [credentials](credentials.md),
* how to [set up](tf-state-setup.md) and [manage state](tf-state-workflow.md),
* which [commands and workflows](tf-workflow.md) to run in order to perform different tasks,
* and more.

The pages in this section are about the above concerns in connection with our AWS Reference Architecture.
