## How we work 

!!! info "binbash work culture"

    :star: **Fully Remote**
     
    binbash was founded as a remote-first company. That means you can always work from home, 
    a co-working place, a nice cafe, or wherever else you feel comfortable, and you'll have almost complete control over
    your working hours. 
    _Why "almost"?_ Because depending on the current projects we'll require few hours of overlap between all Leverage
    collaborators for some specific meetings or shared sessions (pair-programming). 
    
    :star: **Distributed Team**
     
    Despite the fact that our collaborators are currently located in üá¶üá∑ Argentina,
    üáßüá∑ Brazil and üá∫üáæ Uruguay, consider we are currently hiring from most countries in the time zones 
    between :earth_americas: GMT-7 (e.g. California, USA) to :earth_africa: GMT+2 (e.g., Berlin, Germany).

    :star: **We promote life-work balance**
     
    Job burnout is an epidemic üôÜ, and we tech workers are especially at risk. So we'll do our best to de-stress 
    our workforce at binbash. In order to achieve this we offer:
    
    - Remote work that lets you control your hours and physical location.
    - Normal working hours (prime-time 9am-5pm GTM-3), in average no more than ~30-40hs per week, and we don't
      work during weekends or your country of residence national holidays.
    - Project management and planning that will take into consideration the time zone of all our team members.
    - A flexible vacation policy where you could take 4 weeks per year away from the keyboard. If more time is needed
      we could always try to arrange it for you. 
    - No ON-CALL rotation. We only offer support contracts with SLAs of responses on prime time business days hours
      exclusively.
    - You will take on big challenges, but the hours are reasonable.
    - Everyone is treated fairly and with respect, but where disagreement and feedback is always welcome.
    - That is welcoming, safe, and inclusive for people of all cultures, genders, and races.

        binbash is a small, distributed startup, so things are changing all the time, and from time to time we all wear

        opportunities to write blog posts, give talks, contribute to open source, go to conferences, talk with customers, 
        do sales calls, think through financial questions, interview candidates, mentor new hires, design products, 
        come up with marketing ideas, discuss strategy, consider legal questions, and all the other tasks that are part
        of working at a small company.
