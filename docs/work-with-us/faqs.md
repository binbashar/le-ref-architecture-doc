## Agreement and statement of work

### Project Kick-Off
!!! question ":rocket: Project Kick-Off"
    Once the **agreement contract** and **NDA** are signed we estimate 15 days to have the team ready to start
    the project following the proposed Roadmap (‚ÄúStatement of work‚Äù) that describes at length exactly
    what you'll receive.

### Assignments and Delivery
!!! question ":card_index_dividers: Assignments and Delivery"
    After gathering all the customer project requirements and specifications we'll adjust the Reference
    Architecture based on your needs. As a result we'll develop and present the Leverage Reference
    Architecture for AWS implementation Roadmap. 

    A typical **Roadmap (‚ÄúStatement of Work‚Äù)** includes a set number of Iterations (sprints). 
    We try to keep a narrow scope for each Iteration so that we can tightly control how hours get spent to
    avoid overruns. We typically avoid adding tasks to a running Iteration so that the scope does not grow. 
    That's also why we have an allocation for to specific long lived tasks:
    
    - **General-Task-1:** DevOps and Solutions Architecture challenge, definitions, tasks (PM), reviews, issues and audit.
    - **General-Task-2:** WEEKLY FOLLOW-UP Meeting, 

    Which is work that falls outside of the current Iteration specific tasks. This is for special
    requests, meetings, pair programming sessions, extra documentation, etc.

    binbash will participate and review the planned tasks along the customer:

    - [x] planned roadmap features
    - [x] bug fixes
    - [x] Implementation support
    
    Using the relevant ticketing system ([Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)) to prioritize and plan the corresponding work plan.

### Reports and Invoicing
!!! question ":bar_chart: Reports and Invoicing"
    Weekly task reports and tasks management agile metrics.
    We use [Toggl](https://toggl.com) to track all our time by client, project, sprint, and developer.
    We then import these hours into [Quickbooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/) for invoicing.

### Rates and Billing
!!! question ":credit_card: Rates and pricing plans"
    
    - [x] **Pre-paid package subscriptions:** A number of prepaid hours is agreed according to the needs 
    of the project. It could be a [**"Basic Plan"**](https://www.binbash.co/pricing)
    of 40 hours per month. Or a [**"Premium Plan"**](https://www.binbash.co/pricing)
    of 80 hours per month (if more hours are needed it could be reviewed). When buying in 
    bulk there is a discount on the value of the hour. When you pay for the package you start discounting
    the hours from the total as they are used, and if there are unused hours left, consider that maximum 20% 
    could be transferred for the next month.

    - [x] [**On-demand Business Subscription**](https://www.binbash.co/pricing): There are
    a certain number of hours tracked each month, as planned tasks are demanded. The total spent hours will be reported 
    each month. There is a monthly minimum of 40 hours per month. Support tasks maximum estimated effort should
    be between 80 and 120 hs / month.

!!! question ":moneybag: Billing"

    Invoices are due within 15 days of issue.
    We accept payments via US Bank ACH, [Bill.com](https://bill.com), and [Payoneer](https://payoneer.com).
