This will become the management account of your AWS Organization . During the creation of the AWS account, a user will be created for you, the root user . This user will take the email and password you provided as login credentials and it will be the main access point of your account (you can see this user represented in the architecture diagram ). The account's name will be given by your project's name followed by -management , since Leverage uses a suffix naming system to differentiate between the multiple accounts of a project. For this guide we'll stick to calling the project MyExample and so, the account name will be myexample-management . Along the same line, we'll use the example.com domain for the email address used to register the account. Adding a -aws suffix to the project's name to indicate that this email address is related to the project's AWS account, we end up with a registration email that looks like myexample-aws@example.com . Email addresses for AWS accounts. Each AWS account requires having a unique email address associated to it. The Leverage Reference Architecture for AWS makes use of multiple accounts to better manage the infrastructure, as such, you will need different addresses for each one. Creating a new email account for each AWS is not a really viable solution to this problem, a better approach is to take advantage of mail services that support aliases. For information regarding how this works: Email setup for your AWS account. Tip To protect your project's management account, enabling Multi Factor Authentication is highly encouraged, also, reviewing the account's billing setup is always a good idea before proceeding. Create an Admin user for the management account \u00b6 To be able to interact with and manage the AWS environment you will need an IAM user with administrator privileges. To accomplish this, sign in to the IAM Console with your recently created account and create a user named mgmt-org-admin . Setting a password is not necessary, since you won't use this user to log into the web console. Give it admin privileges by attaching the AdministratorAccess policy to it, there's no need to add the user to any group. Generate programmatic access keys for the Admin user \u00b6 Lastly, generate programmatic access keys for the mgmt-org-admin user, and then either copy them or download the .csv file that AWS generates for you. In both cases, store the credentials in a secure location. For more detailed information on setting up your AWS account: Organization account setup guide Next steps \u00b6 You have successfully created and configured the AWS account for your Leverage project.

Let's get to it. Create the project directory \u00b6 Each Leverage project must be in its own working directory. Create the directory for your project. mkdir myexample cd myexample Initialize the Leverage project \u00b6 When setting up a Leverage project the directory where it will reside needs to be initialized leverage project init [09:30:54.027] INFO No Leverage directory found in user's home.

More information on project init Initializing a project creates the global configurations directory for Leverage CLI and downloads the templates used to generate the project's files structure. It then initializes a git repository in the working directory, and creates a file called project.yaml . Leverage projects are by design repositories to leverage some of the capabilities of git and because it is assumed that the code in the project will be versioned. Fill in the configuration file \u00b6 Once the project is initialized you need to fill in the correct information for the project in the configuration file. After filling in the data you will end up with a configuration file similar to the one below. Indicated by arrows are the fields that were modified.

From now on, each user should generate their personal programmatic keys and enable Multi Factor Authentication for their interactions with the AWS environment. Let's take a look at the steps required to accomplish this. Get the temporary password to access AWS console \u00b6 We'll take the place of natasha.romanoff to exemplify the process. When Natasha's user was created, an initial random password was also created alongside it. That password was encrypted using her GPG key, as it was shown in the management account's and in the security account's identities layers. As Natasha, you need to access that password so that you can create your programmatic keys to interact with the environment through Leverage. First, for the management account, change the value sensitive to true in the output block user_natasha_romanoff_login_profile_encrypted_password of management/global/base-identities/outputs.tf : output \"user_natasha_romanoff_login_profile_encrypted_password\" { description = \"The encrypted password, base64 encoded\" value = module.user [ \"natasha.romanoff\" ]. iam_user_login_profile_encrypted_password sensitive = true } Then, in the global/base-identities directory, run: leverage terraform apply leverage terraform output ... user_natasha_romanoff_login_profile_encrypted_password = \"SipVOzVtNTI0Ml...EZmJFxxQSteYQ==\" user_natasha_romanoff_name = \"natasha.romanoff\" ... Extract the value of the password field form the output and decrypt it . Now, log in the AWS Console using the management account id: 000123456789 , which can be extracted from the project.yaml or config/common.tfvars files, your IAM user name: natasha.romanoff , and your recently decrypted password. This password should be changed during this procedure. Proceed to enable a virtual MFA device for your user , and generate programmatic keys for it . Make sure to keep these keys in a safe location. As Natasha also has an IAM user for the security account besides the one in management , these steps should be repeated for that account, making sure of logging in the AWS console with the proper account id. Keep in mind that these are two different IAM users in two different accounts , so their credentials are not interchangeable . Configure the new credentials \u00b6 To be able to use the generated programmatic keys, you need to configure them in your local environment.

If MFA is not enabled, any action on the project will be executed using the bootstrap credentials. Enable MFA \u00b6 The last step is to enable Multi Factor Authentication locally. The procedure is slightly different for a management IAM user and security IAM user, so we'll walk through both of them. Management user \u00b6 To enable MFA for a management account user, you need to enable this feature individually for the role OrganizationAccountAccessRole in all accounts of the infrastructure. So first, we'll take care of the management account: Move into the account's identities layer: cd management/global/base-identities Change the value role_requires_mfa for the role iam_assumable_role_oaar in roles.tf to true . By default this value is false , that is to say, MFA is disabled for the role. module \"iam_assumable_role_oaar\" { ... # # MFA setup # role_requires_mfa = false -> true ... } And run: leverage terraform apply You now should repeat these steps for the remaining accounts, in this guide's case, the security and shared accounts. Once the change is applied in all layers, change the value of profile in management/config/backend.tfvars # # Backend Configuration # # AWS Profile (required by the backend but also used for other resources) profile = \"me-bootstrap\" ... To <short project name>-management-oaar , which in the case of this guide, would result in: me-bootstrap \u2192 me-management-oaar By doing this, you are effectively switching from using the bootstrap credentials to the management credentials profile for this specific account. Lastly, set MFA_ENABLED in the file build.env , located in the project's root directory, to true . Security user \u00b6 To enable MFA for a security account user, the procedure is simpler but it has to be performed in all accounts but management . In the case of this guide, you need to make changes in the security account as well as in the shared account. Set profile in config/backend.tfvars for each account to <short project name>-<account>-devops . That is: me-security-oaar \u2192 me-security-devops for the security account me-shared-oaar \u2192 me-shared-devops for the shared account Similarly to the management user's MFA enabling step, you are switching from using bootstrap credentials to the respective profile for each account of the security credentials. As a last step you need to make sure that MFA_ENABLED is set to true in the build.env file. Next steps \u00b6 Now you not only have a fully functional landing zone configuration deployed, but also the users to interact with it are correctly configured in both the AWS and local environment.

Serverless is the native architecture of the cloud that enables you to shift more of your operational responsibilities to AWS, increasing your agility and innovation. Serverless allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. It eliminates infrastructure management tasks such as server or cluster provisioning, patching, operating system maintenance, and capacity provisioning. You can build them for nearly any type of application or backend service, and everything required to run and scale your application with high availability is handled for you. Why use serverless? Serverless enables you to build modern applications with increased agility and lower total cost of ownership. Building serverless applications means that your developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises.

For the Leverage AWS Reference Architecture we heavily depend on AWS IAM roles , which is a standalone IAM entity that: Allows you to attach IAM policies to it, Specify which other IAM entities to trust, and then Those other IAM entities can assume the IAM role to be temporarily get access to the permissions in those IAM policies. The two most common use cases for IAM roles are Service roles: Whereas an IAM user allows a human being to access AWS resources, one of the most common use cases for an IAM role is to allow a service\u2014e.g., one of your applications, a CI server, or an AWS service\u2014to access specific resources in your AWS account. For example, you could create an IAM role that gives access to a specific S3 bucket and allow that role to be assumed by one of your EC2 instances or Lambda functions. The code running on that AWS compute service will then be able to access that S3 bucket (or any other service you granted through this IAM roles) without you having to manually copy AWS credentials (i.e., access keys) onto that instance. Cross account access: Allow to grant an IAM entity in one AWS account access to specific resources in another AWS account. For example, if you have an IAM user in AWS account A, then by default, that IAM user cannot access anything in AWS account B. However, you could create an IAM role in account B that gives access to a specific S3 bucket (or any necessary AWS services) in AWS account B and allow that role to be assumed by an IAM user in account A. That IAM user will then be able to access the contents of the S3 bucket by assuming the IAM role in account B. This ability to assume IAM roles across different AWS accounts is the critical glue that truly makes a multi AWS account structure possible. How IAM roles work? \u00b6 Figure: Example of AWS cross-account AWS access. (Source: Kai Zhao, \"AWS CloudTrail Now Tracks Cross-Account Activity to Its Origin\" , AWS Security Blog, accessed November 17th 2020). Main IAM Roles related entities IAM policies \u00b6 Just as you can attach IAM policies to an IAM user and IAM group, you can attach IAM policies to an IAM role. Trust policy \u00b6 You must define a trust policy for each IAM role, which is a JSON document (very similar to an IAM policy) that specifies who can assume this IAM role. For example, we present below a trust policy that allows this IAM role to be assumed by an IAM user named John in AWS account 111111111111: { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : \"sts:AssumeRole\" , \"Principal\" : { \"AWS\" : \"arn:aws:iam::111111111111:user/John\" } } ] } Note that a trust policy alone does NOT automatically give John permissions to assume this IAM role. Cross-account access always requires permissions in both accounts (2 way authorization). So, if John is in AWS account 111111111111 and you want him to have access to an IAM role called DevOps in account B ID 222222222222, then you need to configure permissions in both accounts: 1. In account 222222222222, the DevOps IAM role must have a trust policy that gives sts:AssumeRole permissions to AWS account A ID 111111111111 (as shown above). 2. 2 nd , in account A 111111111111, you also need to attach an IAM policy to John\u2019s IAM user that allows him to assume the DevOps IAM role, which might look like this: { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : \"sts:AssumeRole\" , \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/DevOps\" } ] } Assuming an AWS IAM role \u00b6 How does it work? IAM roles do not have a user name, password, or permanent access keys. To use an IAM role, you must assume it by making an AssumeRole API call (v\u00eda SDKs API , CLI or Web Console , which will return temporary access keys you can use in follow-up API calls to authenticate as the IAM role. The temporary access keys will be valid for 1-12 hours (depending on your current validity expiration config), after which you must call AssumeRole again to fetch new temporary keys. Note that to make the AssumeRole API call, you must first authenticate to AWS using some other mechanism. For example, for an IAM user to assume an IAM role, the workflow looks like this: Figure: Assuming an AWS IAM role. (Source: Gruntwork.io, \"How to configure a production-grade AWS account structure using Gruntwork AWS Landing Zone\" , Gruntwork.io Production deployment guides, accessed November 17th 2020). Basic AssumeRole workflow Authenticate using the IAM user\u2019s permanent AWS access keys Make the AssumeRole API call AWS sends back temporary access keys You authenticate using those temporary access keys Now all of your subsequent API calls will be on behalf of the assumed IAM role, with access to whatever permissions are attached to that role IAM roles and AWS services Most AWS services have native support built-in for assuming IAM roles. For example: You can associate an IAM role directly with an EC2 instance (instance profile), and that instance will automatically assume the IAM role every few hours, making the temporary credentials available in EC2 instance metadata. Just about every AWS CLI and SDK tool knows how to read and periodically update temporary credentials from EC2 instance metadata, so in practice, as soon as you attach an IAM role to an EC2 instance, any code running on that EC2 instance can automatically make API calls on behalf of that IAM role, with whatever permissions are attached to that role. This allows you to give code on your EC2 instances IAM permissions without having to manually figure out how to copy credentials (access keys) onto that instance. The same strategy works with many other AWS services: e.g., you use IAM roles as a secure way to give your Lambda functions, ECS services, Step Functions, and many other AWS services permissions to access specific resources in your AWS account.

Useful data here can be interpreted and alerts can be generated with Cloudwatch alerts and can also be used as a source for Grafana. Although this is a very good offering, we have found it to be incomplete and highly bound to AWS services but not integrated enough with the rest of the ecosystem. Prometheus: This is an open source tool (by Soundcloud) that is essentially a time-series database. It stores metrics, and it has the advantage of being highly integrated with all Kubernetes things. In fact, Kubernetes is already publishing various metrics in Prometheus format \u201cout of the box\u201d. It\u2019s alerting capabilities are also remarkable, and it can all be kept as code in a repository. It has a big community behind it, and it\u2019s not far fetched at this point to include a library in your own application that provides you with the ability to create an endpoint that publishes certain metrics about your own application, that we can graph or alert based on them.

Graphing metrics Grafana is the standard open source visualization tool which can be used on top of a variety of different data stores. It can use prometheus as a source, and there are many open source dashboards and plugins available that provide great visualization of how things are running, and we can also build our own if necessary. If something is left out of prometheus and already available in Cloudwatch metrics we can easily integrate it as a source for Grafana as well, and build dashboards that integrate these metrics and even do some intelligence on them coming from multiple origins.

Useful data here can be interpreted and alerts can be generated with Cloudwatch alerts and can also be used as a source for Grafana. Although this is a very good offering, we have found it to be incomplete and highly bound to AWS services but not integrated enough with the rest of the ecosystem. Prometheus: This is an open source tool (by Soundcloud) that is essentially a time-series database. It stores metrics, and it has the advantage of being highly integrated with all Kubernetes things. In fact, Kubernetes is already publishing various metrics in Prometheus format \u201cout of the box\u201d. It\u2019s alerting capabilities are also remarkable, and it can all be kept as code in a repository. It has a big community behind it, and it\u2019s not far fetched at this point to include a library in your own application that provides you with the ability to create an endpoint that publishes certain metrics about your own application, that we can graph or alert based on them. Figure: Monitoring metrics and log architecture diagram (just as reference). (Source: Binbash Leverage, \"AWS Well Architected Reliability Report example\" , Binbash Leverage Doc, accessed November 18th 2020). Graphing metrics Grafana is the standard open source visualization tool which can be used on top of a variety of different data stores. It can use prometheus as a source, and there are many open source dashboards and plugins available that provide great visualization of how things are running, and we can also build our own if necessary. If something is left out of prometheus and already available in Cloudwatch metrics we can easily integrate it as a source for Grafana as well, and build dashboards that integrate these metrics and even do some intelligence on them coming from multiple origins.

Alerting based on metrics Although Grafana already has alerting capabilities built in, we rather (most of the times) have Prometheus alerting engine configured, because we can have really customize and specify alerts.

We recommend this scenario if you want to run a public-facing web application, while maintaining back-end servers that aren't publicly accessible. A common example is a multi-tier website, with a Load Balancer (ALB | NLB) in a public subnet, or other public facing routing service like AWS CloudFront or Api Gateway, and our web servers (Lambda, EKS, ECS, EC2) and database (RDS, DynamoDB, etc) servers in private subnets. You can set up security (SGs, ACLs, WAF) and routing so that the web servers can communicate internally (even between VPC accounts or VPN Endpoints) with all necessary services and components such as databases, cache, queues, among others. The services running in the public subnet, like an ALB or NLB can send outbound traffic directly to the Internet, whereas the instances in the private subnet can't. Instead, the instances in the private subnet can access the Internet by using a network address translation (NAT) gateway that resides in the public subnet. The database servers can connect to the Internet for software updates using the NAT gateway (if using RDS this is transparently provided by AWS), but the Internet cannot establish connections to the database servers. So, whenever possible all our AWS resources like EC2, EKS, RDS, Lambda, SQS will be deployed in VPC private subnets and we'll use a NAT device (Nat Gateway) to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet (for example, for software updates) or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating connections with the instances. A NAT device forwards traffic from the instances in the private subnet to the internet (via the VPC Internet Gateway) or other AWS services, and then sends the response back to the instances. When traffic goes to the internet, the source IPv4 address is replaced with the NAT device\u2019s address and similarly, when the response traffic goes to those instances, the NAT device translates the address back to those instances\u2019 private IPv4 addresses.

There are many strategies that can be implemented to achieve this, and deciding between them is a matter of analyzing how much is worth to invest based on calculation of damages suffered if the application is not available for a given period of time. It is based on this factor (time) that disaster recovery plans are based on. Factors that need to be determined per application are: RTO and RPO Recovery time objective (RTO): This represents the time it takes after a disruption to restore a business process to its service level. For example, if a disaster occurs at 12:00 PM (noon) and the RTO is eight hours, the DR process should restore the business process to the acceptable service level by 8:00 PM. Recovery point objective (RPO): This is the acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. For example, if a disaster occurs at 12:00 PM (noon) and the RPO is one hour, the system should recover all data that was in the system before that hour. High Availability Configuration Strategies \u00b6 After deciding RTO and RPO we have options available to achieve the time objectives: HA Strategies Backup and restore: In most traditional environments, data is backed up to tape and sent off-site regularly. The equivalent in AWS would be to take backups in the form of snapshots and copy them to another region for RDS instances, EBS volumes, EFS and S3 buckets. The plan details the step-by-step procedure to recover a fully working production environment based on these backups being restored on freshly provisioned infrastructure, and how to rollback to a regular production site once the emergency is over. Pilot Light Method: The term pilot light is often used to describe a DR scenario in which a minimal version of an environment is always running in AWS. Very similar to \u201cBackup and restore\u201d except a minimal version of key infrastructure components is provisioned in a separate region and then scaled up in case of disaster declaration. Warm standby active-passive method: The term warm-standby is used to describe a DR scenario in which a scaled-down version of a fully-functional environment is always running in the cloud. Enhancement of Pilot Light in which a minimal version is created of all components, not just critical ones. Multi-Region active-active method: By architecting multi region applications and using DNS to balance between them in normal production status, you can adjust the DNS weighting and send all traffic to the AWS region that is available, this can even be performed automatically with Route53 or other DNS services that provide health check mechanisms as well as load balancing.

For example, if a disaster occurs at 12:00 PM (noon) and the RTO is eight hours, the DR process should restore the business process to the acceptable service level by 8:00 PM. Recovery point objective (RPO): This is the acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. For example, if a disaster occurs at 12:00 PM (noon) and the RPO is one hour, the system should recover all data that was in the system before that hour.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"how-it-works/features/reliability/dr/#high-availability-configuration-strategies","text":"After deciding RTO and RPO we have options available to achieve the time objectives: HA Strategies Backup and restore: In most traditional environments, data is backed up to tape and sent off-site regularly. The equivalent in AWS would be to take backups in the form of snapshots and copy them to another region for RDS instances, EBS volumes, EFS and S3 buckets. The plan details the step-by-step procedure to recover a fully working production environment based on these backups being restored on freshly provisioned infrastructure, and how to rollback to a regular production site once the emergency is over. Pilot Light Method: The term pilot light is often used to describe a DR scenario in which a minimal version of an environment is always running in AWS. Very similar to \u201cBackup and restore\u201d except a minimal version of key infrastructure components is provisioned in a separate region and then scaled up in case of disaster declaration. Warm standby active-passive method: The term warm-standby is used to describe a DR scenario in which a scaled-down version of a fully-functional environment is always running in the cloud. Enhancement of Pilot Light in which a minimal version is created of all components, not just critical ones. Multi-Region active-active method: By architecting multi region applications and using DNS to balance between them in normal production status, you can adjust the DNS weighting and send all traffic to the AWS region that is available, this can even be performed automatically with Route53 or other DNS services that provide health check mechanisms as well as load balancing.

Leverage CLI Documentation Sources \u00b6 leverage-cli github leverage-cli pypi How Leverage CLI came about \u00b6 The multiple tools and technologies required to work with a Leverage project were initially handled through a Makefiles system. Not only to automate and simplify the different tasks, but also to provide a uniform user experience during the management of a project. As a result of more and more features being added and the Leverage Reference Architecture becoming broader and broader, our Makefiles were growing large and becoming too repetitive, and thus, harder to maintain. Also, some limitations and the desire for a more friendly and flexible language than that of Makefiles made evident the need for a new tool to take their place. Python, a language broadly adopted for automation due to its flexibility and a very gentle learning curve seemed ideal. Even more so, Pynt, a package that provides the ability to define and manage tasks as simple Python functions satisfied most of our requirements, and thus, was selected for the job. Some gaps still remained but with minor modifications these were bridged. Gradually, all capabilities originally implemented through Makefiles were migrated to Python as libraries of tasks that still resided within the Leverage Reference Architecture. But soon, the need to deliver these capabilities pre-packaged in a tool instead of embedded in the infrastructure definition became apparent, and were re-implemented in the shape of built-in commands of Leverage CLI.

Consultant will use a trunk-based branching strategy with short-lived feature branches ( feature/ID-XXX -> `master), and members from either the Consultant or the Client will be reviewers of every code delivery to said repositories (at least 1 approver per Pull Request). Infra as code deployments should run from the new feature/ID-XXX or master branch. feature/ID-XXX branch must be merged immediately (ASAP) via PR to the master branch. Consideration: validating that the changes within the code will only affect the desired target resources is the responsibility of the executor (to ensure everything is OK please consider exec after review/approved PR). Infra as Code + GitOps After deployment via IaC (Terraform, Ansible & Helm) all subsequent changes will be performed via versioned controlled code, by modifying the corresponding repository and running the proper IaC Automation execution. All AWS resources will be deployed via Terraform and rarely occasional CloudFormation, Python SDK & AWS CLI when the resource is not defined by Terraform (almost none scenario). All code and scripts will be included in the repository. We'll start the process via Local Workstations. Afterwards full exec automation will be considered via: Github Actions, ,Gitlab Pipelines or equivalent preferred service. Consideration: Note that any change manually performed will generate inconsistencies on the deployed resources (which left them out of governance and support scope). Server OS provisioning : Provisioning via Ansible for resources that need to be provisioned on an OS. Containers Orchestration: Orchestration via Terraform + Helm Charts for resources that need to be provisioned in Kubernetes (with Docker as preferred container engine). Pre-existing AWS Accounts: All resources will be deployed in several new AWS accounts created inside the Client AWS Organization. Except for the AWS Legacy Account invitation to the AWS Org and OrganizationAccountAccessRole creation in it, there will be no intervention whatsoever in Client Pre-existing accounts, unless required by Client authority and given a specific requirement.

Consultant will use a trunk-based branching strategy with short-lived feature branches ( feature/ID-XXX -> `master), and members from either the Consultant or the Client will be reviewers of every code delivery to said repositories (at least 1 approver per Pull Request). Infra as code deployments should run from the new feature/ID-XXX or master branch. feature/ID-XXX branch must be merged immediately (ASAP) via PR to the master branch. Consideration: validating that the changes within the code will only affect the desired target resources is the responsibility of the executor (to ensure everything is OK please consider exec after review/approved PR). Infra as Code + GitOps After deployment via IaC (Terraform, Ansible & Helm) all subsequent changes will be performed via versioned controlled code, by modifying the corresponding repository and running the proper IaC Automation execution. All AWS resources will be deployed via Terraform and rarely occasional CloudFormation, Python SDK & AWS CLI when the resource is not defined by Terraform (almost none scenario). All code and scripts will be included in the repository. We'll start the process via Local Workstations. Afterwards full exec automation will be considered via: Github Actions, ,Gitlab Pipelines or equivalent preferred service. Consideration: Note that any change manually performed will generate inconsistencies on the deployed resources (which left them out of governance and support scope). Server OS provisioning : Provisioning via Ansible for resources that need to be provisioned on an OS. Containers Orchestration: Orchestration via Terraform + Helm Charts for resources that need to be provisioned in Kubernetes (with Docker as preferred container engine). Pre-existing AWS Accounts: All resources will be deployed in several new AWS accounts created inside the Client AWS Organization. Except for the AWS Legacy Account invitation to the AWS Org and OrganizationAccountAccessRole creation in it, there will be no intervention whatsoever in Client Pre-existing accounts, unless required by Client authority and given a specific requirement.

Modernize applications architecture (loosely coupled and modular) Strategically decompose the monolith into a fine-grained, loosely coupled modular architecture to increase both development and business agility. When the system architecture is designed to allow teams to test, deploy and change systems without relying on other teams, they require little communication to get the job done. In other words, both the architecture and the teams are loosely coupled. Innovation - Rapidly adopt new technologies and reduce development time: Use Leverage Reference Architecture and for AWS + our libraries to provide a collection of cloud application architecture components to build and deploy faster in the cloud. Building a cloud Landing Zone is complex, especially since most companies have little or no expertise in this area. And it can take a significant amount of time to get it right. Leverage a reference architecture to give you an AWS Landing Zone that provides a consistent and solid \"foundations\" to bootstrap your project in the cloud. The code solution implements the best AWS Well-Architected Framework practices as well as the battle-tested tech experience and years of knowledge of our contributors. Hours or days, not weeks or months Leverage implements infrastructure as code at all times. We have rolled this out using Terraform, and has been fully proven in AWS and other Terraform providers that are part of our reference architecture like Kubernetes, Helm and Hashicorp Vault. By using the leverage cli , our binary will help you to quickly bootstrap your AWS Landing Zone in a matter of hours (or at most a few days). It's not just a pile of scripts It's not just another layer of untested, one time and stand-alone developed scripts. The code is modularized and well designed under best practices, our leverage cli has both unit and integration tests. While our Terraform code has been extensively E2E tested. Moreover, 100% of the code is yours (to modify, extend, reuse, etc), with no vendor locking and vendor licensing fees. We use the MIT license, so you can take the code, modify it and use it as your private code. All we ask in return is a friendly greeting and that (if possible) consider contributing to Binbash Leverage project. Implement Leverage yourself or we can deploy it for you! DevOps culture and methodologies Team agility and continuous improvements based on feedback loops are some of the main drivers of cloud adoption, and IAC's goal of reducing the frequency of deployment of both infrastructure and applications are some of the most important aspects of DevOps practices. We continue to apply these methodologies to achieve a DevOps first culture. We have experienced and demonstrated their potential and have practiced them in dozens of projects over the past 5 years. The Leverage reference architecture for AWS combines a set of application best practices, technology patterns and a common CI/CD deployment approach through leverage cli for all your application environments. As a result, we are pursuing a world-class software delivery performance through optimized collaboration, communication, reliability, stability, scalability and security at ever-decreasing cost and effort. Repeatable, composable and extensible immutable infrastructure The best high-performance development teams create and recreate their development and production environments using infrastructure as code (IaC) as part of their daily development processes. The leverage cli allows to build repeatable and immutable infrastructure. So your cloud development, staging and production environments will consistently be the same. Why Leverage for DevOps Engineers, Cloud Architects and Software Engineers? \u00b6 Provisioning infrastructure as code (Iac) Instead of manually provisioning infrastructure, the real benefits of cloud adoption come from orchestrating infrastructure through code. However, this is really challenging to achieve, there are literally thousands of tiny things and configs to consider and they all seem to take forever. Our experience is that it can take teams up to 24 months to achieve a desired infra state in AWS. By using Leverage you could get your AWS Landing-Zone in few weeks, or your entire AWS Well-Architected based cloud solution within 1 to 3 months (depending on your project complexity needs). We've done it before (don't reinvent the wheel) Often, development teams have similar and recurring requests such as: iam, networking, security, storage, databases, compute and secret management, etc. Binbash Leverage has been proven in dozen of project to create software-defined (IaC) AWS environments. Best practices baked in the code Leverage provides IaC reference architecture for AWS hosted applications infrastructure. This is baked into the code as a combination of the best AWS Well-Architected framework practices and the experience of having successfully orchestrated many customers to AWS cloud. On-demand infra deployment Leverage provides your DevOps, Cloud, SRE and Development teams with the ability to provision on-demand infrastructure, granting that it will meet the rigorous security requirements of modern cloud native best practices. It fully implements AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF) and best DevOps practices, including practices, including collaboration, version control, CI/CD, continuous testing, cloud infrastructure and losely couple architectures. Easier to support and maintain Leverage IaC approach significantly reduce your AWS infra deployment, config and support burden and reduce risk. Our code backed provisioning has been rigorously tested many times, eliminating the possibility of manual errors. Because the entire infrastructure is deployed from the same proven code, the consistency your cloud environments will simplify your setup and maintenance. Use the versioned code to iterate and improve, extend or compose your internal processes as your cloud operating model evolves. There is no vendor lock-in. You own the solution With Leverage you own 100% of the code with no lock-in clauses. If you choose to leave Leverage , you will still have your entire AWS cloud infrastructure that you can access and manage. If you drop Leverage , you will still have your entire cloud native infrastructure code (Terraform, Helm, Ansible, Python). It\u2019s 100% Open Source on GitHub and is free to use with no strings attached under MIT license (no licensing fees), and you are free to commercially and privately use, distribute and modify. Consistent environments (Dev/prod parity) Keep development, staging, and production cloud envs parity. Infrastructure as code allow us to define and provisioning all infrastructure components (think networks, load balancers, databases, security, compute and storage, etc.) using code. Leverage uses Terraform as the IaC language, to deploy and setup all the AWS, Kubernetes and Hashicorp Vault resources (it has support for multiple cloud and technology providers). Backed by code, your cloud environments are built exactly the identical way all the time. Finally, this will result in no differences between development, staging and production. Development in production like envs IaC allows your development team to deploy and test the AWS infrastructure as if it were application code. Your development is always done in production-like environments. Provision your cloud test and sandbox environments on demand and tear them down when all your testing is complete. Leverage takes all the pain out of maintaining production-like environments, with stable infra releases. It eliminates the unpredictability of wondering if what actually worked in your development envs will work in production.","title":"Why Leverage?"},{"location":"how-it-works/ref-architecture/general-concepts/why-leverage/#why-leverage","text":"","title":"Why Leverage?"},{"location":"how-it-works/ref-architecture/general-concepts/why-leverage/#the-problem","text":"Figure: Why Leverage?

Based on five pillars \u2014 operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization \u2014 AWS Well-Architected provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and implement designs that can scale over time. Read More: AWS Well-architected Why Infra as Code (IaC) & Terraform\u2753 Confidence: A change breaks the env? Just roll it back. Still not working? Build a whole new env with a few keystrokes. IaC enables this. Repeatability: Allows your infra to be automatically instantiated, making it easy to build multiple identical envs. Troubleshooting: Check source control and see exactly what changed in the env. As long as you are diligent and don\u2019t make manual envs changes, then IaC can be a game changer. DR: Require the ability to set up an alternate env in a different DC or Region. IaC makes this a much more manageable prospect. Auditability: You will need to be able to audit both changes and access to an env, IaC gives you this right out of the box. Visibility: As an env expands over time, is challenging to tell what has been provisioned. In the #cloud this can be a huge #cost issue. IaC allows tracking your resources. Portability: Some IaC techs are #multicloud. Also, translating #Terraform from one cloud provider to another is considerably more simple than recreating your entire envs in a cloud-specific tool. Security: See history of changes to your SG rules along with commit messages can do wonders for being confident about the security configs of your envs. Terraform allows to codify your application infrastructure, reduce human error and increase automation by provisioning infrastructure as code. With TF we can manage infrastructure across clouds and provision infrastructure across 300+ public clouds and services using a single workflow. Moreover it helps to create reproducible infrastructure and provision consistent testing, staging, and production environments with the same configuration. Terraform has everything we expect from a IaC framework: open source, cloud-agnostic provisioning tool that supported immutable infrastructure, a declarative language, and a client-only architecture.

Based on five pillars \u2014 operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization \u2014 AWS Well-Architected provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, and implement designs that can scale over time. Read More: AWS Well-architected Why Infra as Code (IaC) & Terraform\u2753 Confidence: A change breaks the env? Just roll it back. Still not working? Build a whole new env with a few keystrokes. IaC enables this. Repeatability: Allows your infra to be automatically instantiated, making it easy to build multiple identical envs. Troubleshooting: Check source control and see exactly what changed in the env. As long as you are diligent and don\u2019t make manual envs changes, then IaC can be a game changer. DR: Require the ability to set up an alternate env in a different DC or Region. IaC makes this a much more manageable prospect. Auditability: You will need to be able to audit both changes and access to an env, IaC gives you this right out of the box. Visibility: As an env expands over time, is challenging to tell what has been provisioned. In the #cloud this can be a huge #cost issue. IaC allows tracking your resources. Portability: Some IaC techs are #multicloud. Also, translating #Terraform from one cloud provider to another is considerably more simple than recreating your entire envs in a cloud-specific tool. Security: See history of changes to your SG rules along with commit messages can do wonders for being confident about the security configs of your envs. Terraform allows to codify your application infrastructure, reduce human error and increase automation by provisioning infrastructure as code. With TF we can manage infrastructure across clouds and provision infrastructure across 300+ public clouds and services using a single workflow. Moreover it helps to create reproducible infrastructure and provision consistent testing, staging, and production environments with the same configuration. Terraform has everything we expect from a IaC framework: open source, cloud-agnostic provisioning tool that supported immutable infrastructure, a declarative language, and a client-only architecture.

Why this workflow \u00b6 The workflow follows the same approach that is used to manage other terraform resources in your AWS accounts. E.g. network, identities, and so on. So we'll use existing AWS resources to create a cluster-template.yaml containing all the resource IDs that Kops needs to create a Kubernetes cluster. Why not directly use Kops CLI to create the K8s cluster as well as the VPC and its other dependencies? While this is a valid approach, we want to manage all these building blocks independently and be able to fully customize any AWS component without having to alter our Kubernetes cluster definitions and vice-versa. This is a fully declarative coding style approach to manage your infrastructure so being able to declare the state of our cluster in YAML files fits 100% as code & GitOps based approach. Figure: [Workflow diagram](https://medium.com/bench-engineering/deploying-kubernetes-clusters-with-kops-and-terraform-832b89250e8e). Kops Cluster Management \u00b6 The 2-kops directory includes helper scripts and Terraform files in order to template our Kubernetes cluster definition. The idea is to use our Terraform outputs from 1-prerequisites to construct a cluster definition. Overview \u00b6 Cluster Management via Kops is typically carried out through the kops CLI. In this case, we use a 2-kops directory that contains a Makefile, Terraform files and other helper scripts that reinforce the workflow we use to create/update/delete the cluster. Workflow \u00b6 This workflow is a little different to the typical Terraform workflows we use. The full workflow goes as follows: Cluster: Creation & Update Modify files under 1-prerequisites Main files to update probably are locals.tf and outputs.tf Mostly before the cluster is created but could be needed afterward Modify cluster-template.yml under 2-kops folder E.g. to add or remove instance groups, upgrade k8s version, etc At 2-kops/ context run make cluster-update will follow the steps below Get Terraform outputs from 1-prerequisites Generate a Kops cluster manifest -- it uses cluster-template.yml as a template and the outputs from the point above as replacement values Update Kops state -- it uses the generated Kops cluster manifest in previous point ( cluster.yml ) Generate Kops Terraform file ( kubernetes.tf ) -- this file represents the changes that Kops needs to apply on the cloud provider. Run make plan To preview any infrastructure changes that Terraform will make. If desired we could submit a PR, allowing you and the rest of the team to understand and review what changes would be made to the Kubernetes cluster before executing make apply ( terraform apply ). This brings the huge benefit of treating changes to our Kubernetes clusters with a GitOps oriented approach, basically like we treat any other code & infrastructure change, and integrate it with the rest of our tools and practices like CI/CD, integration testing, replicate environments and so on. Run make apply To apply those infrastructure changes on AWS. Run make cluster-rolling-update To determine if Kops needs to trigger some changes to happen right now (dry run) These are usually changes to the EC2 instances that won't get reflected as they depend on the autoscaling Run make cluster-rolling-update-yes To actually make any changes to the cluster masters/nodes happen Cluster: Deletion To clean-up any resources created for your K8s cluster, you should run: At 2-kops folder context run make destroy This will execute a terraform destroy of all the kubernets.tf declared AWS resources. At 2-kops folder context run cluster-destroy Will run Kops destroy cluster -- only dry run, no changes will be applied Exec cluster-destroy-yes Kops will effectively destroy all the remaining cluster resources. Finally if at 1-prerequisites exec make destroy This will remove Kops state S3 bucket + any other extra resources you've provisioned for your cluster. Typical Workflow \u00b6 The workflow may look complicated at first but generally it boils down to these simplified steps: 1. Modify cluster-template.yml 2. Run make cluster-update 3. Run make apply 4. Run make cluster-rolling-update-yes What about persistent and stateful K8s resources? This approach will work better the more stateless your Kubernetes workloads are. Treating Kubernetes clusters as ephemeral and replaceable infrastructure requires to consider not to use persistent volumes or the drawback of difficulties when running workloads such as databases on K8s. We feel pretty confident that we can recreate our workloads by applying each of our service definitions, charts and manifests to a given Kubernetes cluster as long as we keep the persistent storage separately on AWS RDS, DynamoDB, EFS and so on. In terms of the etcd state persistency, Kops already provisions the etcd volumes (AWS EBS) independently to the master instances they get attached to. This helps to persist the etcd state after rolling update your master nodes without any user intervention. Moreover simplifying volume backups via EBS Snapshots (consider https://github.com/binbashar/terraform-aws-backup-by-tags). We also use a very valuable backup tool named Velero (formerly Heptio Ark - https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero) to o back up and restore our Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes.

The role to be assumed via SSO is configured: # SSO sso_role = \"DevOps\" This is the role for which credentials will be obtained via SSO when operating in the current layer. Authentication via SSO \u00b6 1. Configuring AWS SSO \u00b6 Once the project has been set up to use SSO, the profiles that AWS CLI will use to authenticate against the service need to be created. To do this, simply run leverage aws configure sso . This step needs to be performed every time the user works in a new account that assumes a different role than the one that they are currently using. For example, if the user is working in the security account, assuming the DevOps role, but needs to operate on a layer of the management account which requires assuming an Administrator role, then SSO needs to be reconfigured. Attention This step simply writes over the credentials files for AWS CLI without asking for confirmation from the user. So it's recommended to backup/wipe old credentials before executing this step in order to avoid loss of credentials or conflicts with profiles having similar names to the ones generated by Leverage. 2. Logging in \u00b6 Having SSO configured, the user will proceed to log in. This is achieved by running leverage aws sso login . In this step, the user is prompted to manually authorize the log in process via a web console. When logging in, Leverage obtains a token from SSO. This token is later used to obtain the credentials needed for the layer the user is working on. This token has a relatively short life span to strike a balance between security and convenience for the user. This step is executed as part of the previous one. So if the user has just configured SSO, this step is not required. 3. Working on a layer \u00b6 When SSO is enabled in the project, Leverage will automatically figure out the required credentials for the current layer, and attempt to get them from AWS every time the user executes a command on it. These credentials are short lived (30 minutes) for security reasons, and will be refreshed automatically whenever they expire. 4. Logging out \u00b6 When the user has finished working, running leverage sso logout wipes out all remaining valid credentials and voids the token obtained from logging in.","title":"SSO"},{"location":"user-guide/features/sso/sso/#aws-sso","text":"Before deploying your AWS SSO definition in the project, it will first have to be manually enabled in the AWS Management Console.

By implementing new auxiliary Leverage tasks you can achieve consistency and homogeneity in the experience of the user when interacting with your Leverage project and simplify the usage of any other tool that you may require.

For this scenario, you can make any task into a private one.

To define a default task, simply assign the already defined task to the special variable __DEFAULT__ . from leverage import task @task () def html ( target = \".\" ): \"\"\"Generate HTML.\"\"\" print ( f \"Generating HTML in directory \\\" { target } \\\" \" ) @task ( ignore = True ) def images (): \"\"\"Prepare images.\"\"\" print ( \"Preparing images...\" ) @task ( html , images ) def start_server ( server = \"localhost\" , port = \"80\" ): \"\"\"Start the server\"\"\" print ( f \"Starting server at { server } : { port } \" ) __DEFAULT__ = start_server The default task is marked as such when listing all available tasks. $ leverage --list-tasks Tasks in build file ` build.py ` : html Generate HTML. images [ Ignored ] Prepare images. start_server [ Default ] Start the server Powered by Leverage 1 .0.10 Build scripts lookup \u00b6 Build scripts are not only looked up in the current directory but also in all parent directories up to the root of the Leverage project. This makes it possible to launch tasks form any directory of the project as long as any parent of the current directory holds a build script. Organizing build scripts \u00b6 Leverage CLI treats the directory in which the build script is found as a python package. This means that you can break up your build files into modules and simply import them into your main build script, encouraging modularity and code reuse. Leverage CLI empowers you to create whole libraries of functionalities for your project. You can use it to better organize your tasks or implement simple auxiliary python functions. This way, given the following folder structure: leverage_project \u251c\u2500\u2500 build.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 deployment_tasks.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 testing_tasks.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 auxiliary_library \u251c\u2500\u2500 reports.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils.py The build script build.py can make use of definitions in the other files by means of importing them. from .deployment_tasks import * from .testing_tasks import unit_tests , functional_tests from .auxiliary_library.reports import coverage_report from .auxiliary_library.utils import format_as_table Importing user defined modules All import statements to user defined modules need to be relative to the main build script in order to function correctly.

If this directory contains a period ( . ) in its name, this will create issues for the importing process. This is because the period is used by python to separate subpackages from their parents. For example, if the directory where the build script build.py is stored is named local.assets , at the time of loading the build script, python will try to locate local.build instead of locating local.assets.build and fail. The same situation will arise from any other subdirectory in the project. When importing modules from those directories, they wont be found. The simple solution to this is to avoid using periods when naming directories. If the build script is located in the project's root folder, this would also apply to that directory.","title":"Custom tasks"},{"location":"user-guide/leverage-cli/tasks/#custom-tasks","text":"The same way we needed to automate or simplify certain tasks or jobs for the user, you may need to do the same in your project.

If this directory contains a period ( . ) in its name, this will create issues for the importing process. This is because the period is used by python to separate subpackages from their parents. For example, if the directory where the build script build.py is stored is named local.assets , at the time of loading the build script, python will try to locate local.build instead of locating local.assets.build and fail. The same situation will arise from any other subdirectory in the project. When importing modules from those directories, they wont be found. The simple solution to this is to avoid using periods when naming directories. If the build script is located in the project's root folder, this would also apply to that directory.","title":"Folder names containing periods"},{"location":"user-guide/leverage-cli/reference/aws/","text":"Command: aws \u00b6 The aws command is a wrapper for a containerized installation of AWS CLI 2.0.

that the resources are not currently created in AWS, basically they've been destroyed or not yet exist. Such layer separation is meant to avoid situations in which a single folder contains a lot of resources. That is important to avoid because at some point, running leverage terraform plan / apply starts taking too long and that becomes a problem. This organization also provides a layout that is easier to navigate and discover. You simply start with the accounts at the top level and then you get to explore the resource categories within each account.","title":"Project Structure"},{"location":"user-guide/ref-architecture-aws/dir-structure/#project-structure","text":"","title":"Project Structure"},{"location":"user-guide/ref-architecture-aws/dir-structure/#filesfolders-organization","text":"The following block provides a brief explanation of the chosen files/folders layout: MyExample project file structure +\ud83d\udcc2 management/ (resources for the management account) ... +\ud83d\udcc2 security/ (resources for the security + users account) ... +\ud83d\udcc2 shared/ (resources for the shared account) ... +\ud83d\udcc2 network/ (resources for the centralized network account) ... +\ud83d\udcc2 apps-devstg/ (resources for apps dev & stg account) ... +\ud83d\udcc2 apps-prd/ (resources for apps prod account) ...

That is important to avoid because at some point, running leverage terraform plan / apply starts taking too long and that becomes a problem.

That means you can always work from home, a co-working place, a nice cafe, or wherever else you feel comfortable, and you'll have almost complete control over your working hours. Why \"almost\"? Because depending on the current projects we'll require few hours of overlap between all Leverage collaborators for some specific meetings or shared sessions (pair-programming). Distributed Team Despite the fact that our collaborators are currently located in \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 Argentina, \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 Brazil and \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddfe Uruguay, consider we are currently hiring from most countries in the time zones between GMT-7 (e.g. California, USA) to GMT+2 (e.g., Berlin, Germany). We promote life-work balance Job burnout is an epidemic \ud83d\ude46, and we tech workers are especially at risk. So we'll do our best to de-stress our workforce at Binbash. In order to achieve this we offer: Remote work that lets you control your hours and physical location. Normal working hours (prime-time 9am-5pm GTM-3), in average no more than ~30-40hs per week, and we don't work during weekends or your country of residence national holidays. Project management and planning that will take into consideration the time zone of all our team members. A flexible vacation policy where you could take 3 weeks per year away from the keyboard. If more time is needed we could always try to arrange it for you. No ON-CALL rotation. We only offer support contracts with SLAs of responses on prime time business days hours exclusively. You will take on big challenges, but the hours are reasonable. Everyone is treated fairly and with respect, but where disagreement and feedback is always welcome. That is welcoming, safe, and inclusive for people of all cultures, genders, and races. Leverage Software / DevOps Engineer Profile \u00b6 What You'll Work On (our tech stack) Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Library Create a collection of reusable, tested, production-ready E2E AWS oriented infrastructure modules (e.g., VPC, IAM, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, EFK, Consul, Vault, Jenkins, etc.) using several tool and languages: Terraform, Ansible, Helm, Dockerfiles, Python, Bash and Makefiles . Reference Architecture Improve, maintain, extend and update our reference architecture, which has been designed under optimal configs for the most popular modern web and mobile applications needs. Its design is fully based on the AWS Well Architected Framework . Open Source & Leverage DevOps Tools Contribute to our open source projects to continue building a fundamentally better DevOps experience, including our open source modules , leverage python CLI , Makefiles Lib among others. Document team knowledge Get siloed and not yet documented knowledge and extend the Leverage documentation , such as creating knowledgebase articles, runbooks, and other documentation for the internal team as well as Binbash Leverage customers. Customer engineering support While participating in business-hours only support rotations, collaborate with customer requests, teach Binbash Leverage and DevOps best-practices, help resolve problems, escalate to internal SMEs, and automate and document the solutions so that problems are mitigated for future scenarios and users. Role scope and extra points! Responsible for the development, maintenance, support and delivery of Binbash Leverage Products. Client side Leverage Reference Architecture solutions implementation, maintenance and support. Client side cloud solutions & tech management (service delivery and project task management). Bring Leverage recs for re-engineering, bug fixes (issues) report and improvements based on real scenario implementations. Mentoring, KT, PRs and team tech follow up both internally and customer facing. Binbash is a small, distributed startup, so things are changing all the time, and from time to time we all wear many hats. You should expect to write lot of code, but, depending on your interests, there will also be lot of opportunities to write blog posts, give talks, contribute to open source, go to conferences, talk with customers, do sales calls, think through financial questions, interview candidates, mentor new hires, design products, come up with marketing ideas, discuss strategy, consider legal questions, and all the other tasks that are part of working at a small company. Nice to have background You hate repeating and doing the same thing twice and would rather spend the time to automate a problem away than do the same task again. You have strong English communication skills and are comfortable engaging with external customers. You know how to write code across the stack ( \u201cDev\u201d ) and feel very comfortable with Infra as Code (\"IaC\"). You have experience running production software environments ( \"Ops\" ). You have a strong background in software engineering and understanding of CI/CD (or you are working hard on it!). You have a passion for learning new technologies, tools and programming languages. Bonus points for a sense of humor, empathy, autonomy and curiosity. Note that even if we're concerned with prior experience like AWS, Linux and Terraform, we're more concerned with curiosity about all areas of the Leverage stack and demonstrated ability to learn quickly and go deep when necessary.","title":"Careers"},{"location":"work-with-us/careers/#careers","text":"","title":"Careers"},{"location":"work-with-us/careers/#how-we-work","text":"Binbash work culture Fully Remote Binbash was founded as a remote-first company.

A typical Roadmap (\u201cStatement of Work\u201d) includes a set number of Iterations (sprints). We try to keep a narrow scope for each Iteration so that we can tightly control how hours get spent to avoid overruns. We typically avoid adding tasks to a running Iteration so that the scope does not grow. That's also why we have an allocation for to specific long lived tasks: General-Task-1: DevOps and Solutions Architecture challenge, definitions, tasks (PM), reviews, issues and audit. General-Task-2: WEEKLY FOLLOW-UP Meeting, Which is work that falls outside of the current Iteration specific tasks.
